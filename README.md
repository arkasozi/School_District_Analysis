# School_District_Analysis


Overview of the school district analysis

In this analysis, we looked at schools, their perfomance, the based performing schools and the worst, analysed the performance accouring to the schhol budget and how the students fared if they were in a district or charter school. We then had to remove the data from Thomas High school grade nine's and reanalyse the data after they had a few issues

When we removed the data, we noticed the avarage pass rates genrerall changed by about 0.1% and I think this is abit negligble in the ense that alot of the data and the remaining facts with regards to budget and school spending all remained about the same after this information was removed
 
 Results
 The removal affecred the data in the Charter school and had an overall drop in passing rate of 3% 
 It shows the math marks were altered alot more compared to the reading score
 The Larger School sizes didnt perform as well as the smaller school sizes
 The schools with bigger budgets per student did not translate to better grades
 Charter schools had a highter passing rate compared to district schools
 
 To conclude, the district schools need to pick a leaf from the charter schools on how to improve their grades and the district school board, need to check how funds are spent to improve the performance
